# SCP - KETER ESCAPE

An Android game based on the [SCP wiki](http://www.scp-wiki.net/) inspired by [Werewolf, also known as Mafia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game)).

The minimum I'm going to make is an offline pass and play version of the game as a simple rebrand of Werewolf. Many more features are planned, such as bluetooth local play and online game, with many other game modes based on the SCP Universe.

###Building
