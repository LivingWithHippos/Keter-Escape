An Android game based on the [SCP wiki](http://www.scp-wiki.net/) inspired by [Werewolf (also known as Mafia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game)).

The basic functionality I'm going for is an offline pass and play version of the game as a simple rebrand of Werewolf. Many more features are planned, such as original functionalities based on the SCP Universe, Bluetooth local play and online competition.

### What is the SCP Wiki?

Freely adapted from Wikipedia:

`The SCP Foundation is a fictional organization documented by the web-based collaborative-fiction project of the same name. It's a secret organization entrusted by governments around the globe to contain and study anomalous individuals, entities, locations, objects, and phenomena operating outside the bounds of natural law (referred to as "SCP objects"). If left uncontained, the objects would pose a direct threat to human life and humanity's perceptions of reality and normalcy.`

Born as a simple wiki project, it now contains around [five thousand articles]([http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-series](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-series), plus [various tales](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-series-1-tales-edition). Thanks to volunteers, it has been translated in [14+ languages](http://scp-int.wikidot.com/). Its contents have inspired [YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr6Ojg6WA9Lk-ynphZE9gtg), [videogames](https://store.steampowered.com/app/700330/SCP_Secret_Laboratory/) and various [short movies](https://www.imdb.com/search/keyword/?keywords=scp).
